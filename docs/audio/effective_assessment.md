# Creating effective assessments

## Help educators use digital tools to create effective assessments that provide timely feedback and support personalized learning.
- How to test technical competency?
- How to test knowledge transfer from a docs experience?
- Pull Request process as an educational process
    - automated test suite (correctness of code)
    - use Github Checks (via API or web UI) to evaluate fuzzier topics
    - Use Pull Request templates to provide familiar structure
    - Educator gets notified of PR, can comment as appropriate on the PR itself
    - When PR is merged, Github user gets social proof on their profile that they have contributed meaningfully to a project
