This gallery is a set of audio, visual, and written artifacts that were created during the course of
Bowling Green State University's MEd. in Instructional Design and Technology program as well personal projects and
professional work.

In general, their content and inspiration live at the intersection of instructional design and developer enablement.
Concretely, this means that many of them focus on methods to improving  _documentation and developer experiences_ by
viewing them as a protracted educational experience.
