# About

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="who" label="Who am I?">

Hailing from the midwest, I spent a decade working as a software engineer building things from custom automotive
hardware and firmware to full-stack software and educational efforts such as
the [Stripe Partner Program](https://stripe.com/partners).

Now, I am pursuing two graduate degrees simultaneously and narrowing my focus to problems at the intersection of
technology, law, and education.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="interests" label="What am I interested in?">

I enjoy thinking about developer enablement and education through the lens of instructional design. I think that
developer enablement can and should be more than just an API reference thrown together haphazardly after the coding and
building is done. I think that when fully executed *developer enablement* can be a series of educational experiences
that empower and enable users to get the most value out of a piece of software and guide them to a deeper understanding
of how to use a particular software solution to its limit.

Aquaponics, and more generally indoor food crop production, fascinates me. I think that the increased need for
foodstuffs and the adverse effects of human-induced climate change have created an environment where indoor food crop
production is quickly becoming a booming field of exploration and rife for advancement (pun intended!).

I also enjoy thinking about programming languages as notational forms of spoken human languages. I find it fascinating
to look at programming languages such as [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language))
, [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
, [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)), [Catala](https://catala-lang.org), and others from
a language pedagogy point-of-view and use tools from linguistic studies to analyze programming languages.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="learn" label="What do I want to learn?">

I want to learn more about automating indoor food crop production and aquaponic growing operations.

I want to learn more about linguistics and language acquisition.

I want to learn about how humans have historically used technology to increase knowledge dissemination and what can be
re-applied to contemporary society for the betterment of all.
