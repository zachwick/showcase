We never really stop and marvel at the fact that we carry magic in our pockets.

We have most of the world at our fingertips and we worry about the color of someone’s skin or who they love. Humans have
crystallized magic and we worry about things more mundane. The depth and breadth of how we have expanded each person’s
reach now touches the outer limits of the solar system.

How come I can communicate with another human half the world away at the speed of light, but people right next to me
want for food and shelter? Why has our magic not solved these obvious problems that humans face? Why it is easier for my
neighbor to order a car than to get a sandwich?
