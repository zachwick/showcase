Two weeks ago I attended PyOhio 2013 – It was freaking awesome! I
had high hopes for PyOhio as the last conference that I attended
was LibrePlanet (which was also fantastic), and PyOhio did not
fail to deliver.

In addition to listening to some really cool talks, I got to give
a (hopefully cool) talk on what I work on all day – Copy.com. The
talks that were presented were on a wide array of Python-centric
topics and ranged from “novice” to “expert” in subject
matter.
The people at PyOhio were just as interesting as the talks. I met
one person from LightSide, who is doing text analysis on student’s
papers. I met another person who is a developer on Firefox for
Android and picked his brain on porting GNU Icecat to
Android. There was another persom that I met who works for Canonical
on one of their webapps – It was great to trade “war stories” and
talk shop.

My talk on a Python FUSE layer for Copy.com went rather well, and
for interested people, there is a video posted at [PyVideo](https://pyvideo.org/video/2271/python-fuse) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpvdOuTzOU0).

I will definitely be going to PyOhio 2014, and will even try to
come up with an exciting Python project to talk about.
